# Pocket to Obsidian

Quick data extraction from [Pocket exports](https://getpocket.com/export), so the full database of saved articles can be used in other contexts.
This repos is a small toy to play around with the
[Data Analysis GPT](https://help.openai.com/en/articles/8555545-file-uploads-with-gpts-and-advanced-data-analysis-in-chatgpt?q=data+analysis),
and with the [ChatGPT.nvim plugin](https://github.com/jackmort/chatgpt.nvim) commands for documentation and unit testing.
